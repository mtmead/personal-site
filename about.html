                Hello! My name is Marianna, I am from Falmouth, Maine, and I am currently a software engineering student. I graduated from College of the Atlantic (COA) in 2018 where I studied honey bees, beekeeping, and photography. While at COA, I focused my studies on community involvement in beekeeping, researching queen honey bees, and digital and alternative photography. After graduating, I worked as a research fellow with the Sustainable Food Systems Research Collaborative and published my research on Rearing Queen Honey Bees.

                In October 2018 I began my service as a Community Gardening and Agroforestry Facilitator Volunteer with the United States Peace Corps in The Gambia, West Africa. My work in the Peace Corps was primarily in beekeeping, including training local beekeepers and working with NGOs to create workshops and training programs to increase nutrition and crop diversity, decrease deforestation, and promote sustainable economic growth through beekeeping. Pictured here: me with my host mother and a workshop I led on rearing queen honey bees. Post Peace Corps, I have worked as a beekeeping and photography intern and as an LLBean employee in packing and shipping.

                My interest in software engineering comes from an increased involvement in gaming and the gaming community over the past couple years. I play a large variety of games including Call of Duty, Dayz, and Project Zomboid. I also moderate for 21 Twitch streams.
